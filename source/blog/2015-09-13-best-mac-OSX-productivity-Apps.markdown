Here is a curated list of the OSX productivity apps I could not live without, and will make your workflow easier and much, much faster.

Click on the app’s names to go to their website.

### [Text Expander](https://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html)

Customize text snippets that can then be accessed via keyboard snippets. Type “,doctype” and see a full fledged html page that’s ready to be developed upon. Setup bootstrap elements and create rows and columns in just 7 keyboard strokes (‘bt;col4′, for example). The sky is the limit.

### [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/)

Boost your productivity by a million percent with this app that’s one keyboard shortcut away and lets you launch custom web searches (Google, Amazon etc), control iTunes, create files, navigate folders etc. It gets even better when you browse third-party extensions on their dedicated website [Packal](http://www.packal.org/)

### [Yoink](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/yoink/id457622435?l=en&mt=12)

Drag files from anywhere on your screen, and a small popup window will appear for you to drop the file and conveniently keep it on the side of your screen. The sidebar remains unobtrusively on the side, and you can now drop it in another window. Extremely useful: you no longer need to resize your windows in order to have both the source and target visible at the same time!

### [Screenfloat](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/screenfloat/id414528154?l=en&mt=12)

Similarly to Yoink, Screenfloat is straightforward and proves extremely useful: it lets you take screenshots of parts of your screen, and which then automatically persist above all your windows. Great to keep info at hand without needing to switch from one window to another.

### [SnapNDrag](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/snapndrag-pro/id430397512?l=en&mt=12)

In the screenshots’ series, here’s a small app that lets you take partial or entire screenshots, and immediately copies i to your clipboard (as well as saving it in a convenient window one keyboard shortcut away.

### [Infinit](https://infinit.io/)

You used to swear by WeTransfer or Dropbox to transfer files? With Infinit, welcome to the future! Transfer files faster than any other apps, not only to friends or coworkers, but also to your own devices. Transfers can be lightning quick as the startup has devised a proprietary algorithm that calculates the fastest way to transfer files using a peer-to-peer technology. Did I mention that there’s no size limit?

### [Dropzone 3](https://aptonic.com/dropzone3/)

Another great app! It may not look like much, but it’s got it where it counts. From a small icon sitting in your Menu bar you can access a plethora of bundled workflows, either proprietary or written (in Ruby or Python) by the community. Upload images to Imgur and automatically get the link to your clipboard, upload files to an S3 bucket, shorten links, move a file to a selected folder, the choice is yours.
