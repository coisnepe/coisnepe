[“Le Wagon”](http://www.lewagon.org/) is a programming bootcamp that was founded in Paris two years ago, but has since expanded to Lebanon ([Beirut](http://www.lewagon.org/fr/beirut)), Belgium ([Brussels](http://www.lewagon.org/fr/brussels)) and the US ([Los Angeles](http://www.lewagon.org/fr/losangeles)), as well as other French cities ([Lille](http://www.lewagon.org/lille) and [Bordeaux](http://www.lewagon.org/bordeaux)).

Their main offer is a 9 weeks long Full Stack bootcamp in which you’ll learn how to make web apps with Ruby on Rails, one of the most popular frameworks these days -it’s based on Ruby. They also teach html, css, Javascript, obviously, in addition to git.

I’ll be attending that Full Stack program from mid-July this year to mid-September. Can’t wait to get things going!
